              Paulo Coelho is a Brazilian author, born on August 24, 1947, in
              Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He is best known for his novel "The
              Alchemist", which has been translated into more than 80 languages
              and sold over 65 million copies worldwide, making it one of the
              best-selling books in history. Coelho's writing often explores

              Before becoming a writer, he had a diverse career: he worked as a
              lyricist, theater director, and journalist, and even faced periods
              of personal struggle, including being institutionalized by his
              parents for his unconventional lifestyle.

              Coelho is also active on social media and engages with his readers
